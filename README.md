Good day. oGo is a start timer for orienteering. It was developed pre Android Studio and was a first experiment in building an Anroid app and using the Java language - do not expect exemplary code! There is a description of oGo 
[here](http://appindesign.com/ogo/). You are welcome to use oGo's code.
