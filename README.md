Update 23 Nov 2025 My thanks to Anders Löfgren and Simon Harston who have revived oGo. Anders revised the coding and re-published it with enhancements on the Google Play Store.

Good day. oGo is a start timer for orienteering. It was developed pre Android Studio and was a first experiment in building an Anroid app and using the Java language - do not expect exemplary code! There is a description of oGo 
[here](http://appindesign.com/ogo/). You are welcome to use oGo's code.
